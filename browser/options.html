    <h2>Private Key</h2>
    <p><b>Do not share this value with anyone.</b>
    <p>Your private key is used to fill out <i>itsame-signature</i> fields in
    pages you visit. The pages can then use your public key to verify you
    created the content. 
    <p><textarea rows="12" cols="70" id="private-key"></textarea>
    <p><b>Security Warning</b>:
    this value is only as secure as your computer is. If your computer is
    compromised then attackers can likely access it. However, it should
    be safe from other extensions or websites you visit.

    <p>On linux you can generate this value with:</p>
    <pre>
mkdir -p ~/.secrets/
openssl genrsa -out ~/.secrets/itsame.secret 4096
openssl rsa -in itsame.secret -pubout &gt; ~/.secrets/itsame.public
    </pre>
