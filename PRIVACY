PRIVACY POLICY for itsame

The itsame software (browser extension and future software in this
repository) works by storing data LOCALLY. It will never be shared or
stored externally by this software in any way.

The LOCAL private key is used to sign payloads in order to prove
identity (that is the purpose of the application).

Signing a payload is proof of identity. Sending a web request with a
signed payload means you are prooving your identity to anyone who can
read that web request. However, those payloads are controlled by the
webpage, not the itsame software.
